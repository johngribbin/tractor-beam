# Tractor Beam

### What is this?

Tractor Beam a React Native prototype to showcase a novel on-boarding experience for Ethereum users that utilizes counterfactual interactions with smart contracts.

This prototype is the result of broad research and development at [ConsenSys Space](https://consensys.space) into how [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) (and blockchains in general) could help to democratize, decentralize and diversify space endeavors.
