# Kuiper Mobile DApp

Open the Terminal and navigate to a directory which you wish to save the Tractor Beam codebase within. Then copy the following commands and paste them, in the order, into your Terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/johngribbin/kuiper-mobile-dapp.git tractor_beam
```

```
cd tractor_beam
```

```
cd client
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

The last command will open a browser window. On the left hand side of this window you should see an option `Run on iOS Simulator`. Click this to open the Tractor Beam app.
