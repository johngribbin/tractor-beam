# Kuiper Mobile DApp

Open a Terminal window and navigate to a directory which you wish to save the Tractor Beam codebase within. Then copy and paste the following commands, one by one in order, into your Terminal. Press enter after you paste each command to run it.

```
git clone https://github.com/johngribbin/kuiper-mobile-dapp.git tractor_beam
```

```
cd tractor_beam
```

```
cd client
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

The last command will open a browser window. On the left hand side of this window you should see an option `Run on iOS Simulator`. Click this to open the Tractor Beam app on an Iphone simulator.
